Two classes

    Tree
    List - for stroing names of actors

List functions:

    
    void PrintList();   
        Print list in order to test code 

    void Delete();
        Delete function to clean up the list

    void AddNode(string);
        takes a string input and adds it to the list

    bool LookFor(string);
        returns true if string "s" was found in the list

Tree Functions:

        bool IsLeaf(Node*);
            Return true if node that is passed has both leftPtr and rightPtr == NULL

        void printFullNode(Node*);
            prints out all of the data from a the node thats passed as an argument

        int GetData(ifstream&);
            gathers all data from a section seperated by blank lines 
                and adds them to a node on the Tree
    
  **(each funciton bellow has a 2nd public function in order to call it from main)

        void AddNodeR(Node* &, string, int, List);
            Adds a Node to the tree and sorts them based on movie title (alphabeticly)

        void deleteTree(Node* &);
            Dealocate all memory from the tree

        void printTree(Node*);
            prints out all data, and lables it, found in every node in tree

        void DisplayTitles(Node*);
            Prints out all titles currently in the tree in alphabetical order

        void DisplayCertinActors(Node*, string);
            prints out all movie titles that the actor "string" was an actor in

        void DisplayAllActors(Node*, string);
            prints out all of the actors for a specific title "string"

        void DisplayMoviesReleased(Node*, int);
            prints out all of the movie titles released in "int" year
